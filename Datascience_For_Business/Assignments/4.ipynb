    "In this assignment, you will begin to work with text data and natural language processing. You will analyze aspects of th DonorsChoose.org program. Aspects of this project were first posed as a Kaggle challenge and the data comes from [Kaggle DonorsChoose.org Application Screening challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/donorschoose-application-screening/data). We have changed the nature of what you need to do in this assignment (so it does not track what was done in the Kaggle Challenge), but nevertheless using or referring to the Kaggle Challenge repository is not allowed for the assignment.\n",

    "Founded in 2000 by a high school teacher in the Bronx, DonorsChoose.org empowers public school teachers from across the country to request much-needed materials and experiences for their students. At any given time, there are thousands of classroom requests that can be brought to life with a gift of any amount. DonorsChoose.org receives hundreds of thousands of project proposals each year for classroom projects in need of funding. Right now, a large number of volunteers is needed to manually screen each submission before it's approved to be posted on the DonorsChoose.org website. In this assignment, you will analyze the text of the essays and requirements from each proposal."
