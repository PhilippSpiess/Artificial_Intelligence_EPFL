# AI/ML

AI projects I have been working on during my Master's at EPFL

## Artificial Neural Networks

- Deep neural network to classify MNIST and Fashion MNIST images
- Reinforcement Learning : Monte Carlo Policy-gradient algoritm using a deep neural network as a function approximator to teach a simulated spaceship how to « land on the moon ». The network takes as input 8 states and returns 4 control output. We also implemented a value network to increase the performance of the program : an adaptive baseline. 

## Data Science for Business

For the final project of the course « Data science for business », we had to predict whether companies with specific attributes were likely to have their share price rise or fall right after the Initial Public Offering. The predictions are based on an existing dataset of many companies with their pre and post IPO valuations.

Two significant steps of the project involved data preprocessing and text analysis with NLP. We predicted the probability that the price would go up or down and even the price itself. The AUC score we obtained for the first task is 0.7. It allows us to think that the model could be used to filter the best opportunities in the market.

## Intelligent Agents

In a group of two, we first implemented in Java a reactive and a deliberative agent in a task-delivery problem using respectively the value iteration and the A* algorithms. We then tackled the coordination of multiple agents using the Stochastic Local Search algorithm. Finally, we competed against the other groups of the class in an auction game. We came out with the second best code (out of 75 groups participating).

## Machine Learning

- Principal component analysis
- Clustering ( K-means, soft K-means, DBSCAN ) 
- Classification ( k-NN, Gaussian mixture models, Support vector machines )
